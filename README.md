# Data_science_Insurance_information
This project was to create some logical functions to traverse a array object using Python to find pieces of information that was relevant 
to the questions I wanted answered.

It is written in plain Python and uses a CSV file to obtain the information, which is then put into seperate arrays to be manipulated further down in the
code base.
